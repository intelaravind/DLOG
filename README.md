DLOG
=====

DLOG 


A program to help debugging and logging


Sample
==================

Check the examples folder for example


Graphs
==================

The graph module can draw pie chart with some simple steps. See the example section for details

Notes
==================

Support for llvm dumping is present. However DLOG can be build without LLVM support, and still be used on LLVM objects. In the latter case, to print LLVM objects it SHOULD be passed as a string and also no formatting will be applied (even for html output)
